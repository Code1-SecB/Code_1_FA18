# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class

In the future, we will submit assignments via GitHub, but for this week you can include the pseudocode (as comments) and the drawing primitives assignment in the same processing (.pde) file and email it to me.

### Pseudocode
- Choose a simple activity such as a chore or daily task that you want to pseudocode (ex. making coffee, brushing teeth, reading a book)
- Write instructions you would use to tell a computer how to do this task - be as specific as possible!
- Think about what items you might have to declare as the "ingredients" of your task (ex. locate toothbrush, locate toothpaste)
- Think about whether a part of the action is repeated (ex. swirling coffee spoon in cup 3 times) and where different options may be available (ex. if it's past 4:00PM, coffee = decaf)

### Drawing Primitives
Go to https://processing.org/reference/ and find a drawing function to experiment with. Look for the 2D Primitives section. Try using them and see what happens. See if you can make an interesting composition with some simple shapes.

When you get errors in your code, document them - write down what they say and try to guess what the error means. When it doesn't give you an error, but it doesn't give you what you think will happen, write that down as well. Keep this documentation as comments in your code.

### Reading
Read FORM+CODE Ch.1 and submit a 100+ word response on Canvas
