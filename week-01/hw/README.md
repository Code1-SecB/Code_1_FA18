### Pseudocode
- Choose a simple activity such as a chore or daily task that you want to pseudocode (ex. making coffee, brushing teeth, reading a book)
- Write instructions you would use to tell a computer how to do this task - be as specific as possible!
- Think about whether a part of the action is repeated (ex. swirling coffee spoon in cup 3 times) and where different options may be available (ex. if it's past 4:00PM, coffee = decaf)

### Drawing Primitives
Go to https://processing.org/reference/ and find a drawing function to experiment with. Look for the 2D Primitives section. Try using them and see what happens.

When you get errors in your code, document them - write down what they say and try to guess what the error means. When it doesn't give you an error, but it doesn't give you what you think will happen, write that down as well. Keep this documentation as comments in your code.
