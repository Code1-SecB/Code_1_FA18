# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Arrays Continued
For this week, review our mouse trail example from class [here]:
- Add comments to show your understanding of each section of the code (it's ok to guess)
- Add to the code so that mouseY values are saved in a separate array
- Use these saved mouseY values to make the composition more interesting (change the position of the ellipses or draw a completely new shape)
- Experiment with "i" to change the size of the ellipses
- Code should be thoroughly commented!
- Any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!

### 2 points extra credit
Review the three challenges we had in class and choose one:
- add comments to the code to explain what is happening (must be thorough!)
- expand the challenge in some way
- please provide a comment to let me know if you're attempting the extra credit

### Reading
Read FORM+CODE Ch.7 and submit a 100+ word response on Canvas
