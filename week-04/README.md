# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Pattern making
Create a pattern or a grid by using [what we learned in class](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/tree/master/week-04/classwork) about 'for' loops and 'if' statements. Refer examples from class inspiration or the listed videos for inspiration. Your composition should include the following:
- one [boolean](https://processing.org/reference/boolean.html) value
- 2 [for loops](https://processing.org/reference/for.html) (they may be nested)
- 2 conditionals - [if](https://processing.org/reference/if.html)/[else](https://processing.org/reference/else.html) statements
- originality (unique drawing or design)
- proper citation (if necessary)
- code should be thoroughly commented!
- Inspiration videos - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIdBGJbCIRE), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sY76MRS_XQ), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwSD0gPnh0k), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBaie2cEg4), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v9YXBX8AVg)

### Extra credit
Use additional logic in your conditional statements:
- [and](https://processing.org/reference/logicalAND.html)
- [or](https://processing.org/reference/logicalOR.html)
- [not](https://processing.org/reference/logicalNOT.html)
