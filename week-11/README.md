# Reading
Skim over the processing [Objects Tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/) and answer the questions posted in the discussion for the week on canvas.

# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

- **Part 1:** Rewrite our [colliding bouncey ball code](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/blob/master/week-06/classwork/w6_03_bounceCollision/w6_03_bounceCollision.pde), so that the bouncey ball and all of its functionality is contained as an object. Use an [arrayList](https://processing.org/reference/ArrayList.html) to generate 10+ colliding bouncey balls. First try to make the ball objects bounce off the canvas boundaries, second think of how you might add collision detection between the balls.
- **Part 2:** Try refactoring the [stepArray tutorial](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/blob/master/week-11/classwork/stepArray/stepArray.pde) from class to use a 2D array, instead of 2 1D arrays.
- please submit as 2 files
- code should be thoroughly commented to show your thought process and problem solving
- any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!
