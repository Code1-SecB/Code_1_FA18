# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Challenge Add-On
CHOOSE ONE of the challenges from class to add on to. The solution code can be found here. These solutions are not commented, so you should add your own comments to reflect your own understanding of how the code is working. Once you have commented the original solutions, expand on the challenge. Some ideas are below:
- Bouncing ball
  - Make the ball start in a random direction and bounce off all edges
  - Make the ball's speed increase each time it bounces
  - Add a force that will slow down the ball's bouncing over time - gravity
- Grow and Shrink
  - Add a limit so that the circle does not shrink past the point where you can click on it or grow outside of the canvas
  - Make a pattern of circles that will grow until their edges touch and then shrink down to a minimum size
  - Make the circles move around randomly and grow at random speeds
- Grid
  - Make the squares you hover over stay the same once they change color so that user can draw
  - Give the user an option to change the fill color or erase what they have drawn
- code should be thoroughly commented!
- any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!

### Extra credit
Use the mousePressed and keyPressed booleans in your code
- [mousePressed](https://processing.org/reference/mousePressed.html)
- [keyPressed](https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed.html)
- please provide a comment to let me know if you're attempting the extra credit
