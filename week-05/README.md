# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Challenge Add-On
**CHOOSE ONE** of the challenges from class to add on to. The solution code can be found [here](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/tree/master/week-05/classwork). These solutions are not commented, so you should **add your own comments to reflect your own understanding of how the code is working**. Once you have commented the original solutions, expand on the challenge. Some ideas are below:
- Bouncing ball
  - Make the ball start in a random direction and bounce off all edges
  - Make the ball's speed increase each time it bounces
  - Add a force that will slow down the ball's bouncing over time - gravity or friction
- Grow and Shrink
  - Add a limit so that the circle does not shrink past the point where you can click on it or grow outside of the canvas
  - Make a pattern of circles that will grow until their edges touch and then shrink down to a minimum size
  - Make the circles move around randomly and grow at random speeds
  - Change the circles' growth rate when they touch other circles
- Grid
  - Make the squares you hover over stay the same once they change color so that user can draw
  - Give the user an option to change the fill color or erase what they have drawn
- Code should be thoroughly commented!
- Any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!

### Extra credit
Use the mousePressed and keyPressed booleans in your code
- [mousePressed](https://processing.org/reference/mousePressed.html)
- [keyPressed](https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed.html)
- please provide a comment to let me know if you're attempting the extra credit

### Extra EXTRA credit
Expand **TWO** of the challenges from class and submit **TWO** assignments.
Usually, extra credit is 1 point. If you work on 2 challenges and submit 2 assignments, I will give you an extra 5 points for the 2nd assignment.

### Reading
Read FORM+CODE Ch.5 and submit a 100+ word response on Canvas

# Classwork
Code from class with notes can be found in the [classwork folder](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/tree/master/week-05/classwork) for this week.
