## Assignment

For this week, we will have an open-ended creative assignment. Use one of the [advanced concepts](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/tree/master/week-13/advancedConcepts) (trig patterns, noise, vectors) as inspiration to create your own composition.
Your composition must include:
  - A custom class and an instance object of that class
  - One of the following: noise, trigonometry, vectors
  - **Code should be thoroughly commented to show your thought**
  - **Any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!**
