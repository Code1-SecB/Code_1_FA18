**Assignment**

For this week, we will have an open-ended creative assignment. Use one of the advanced concepts (trig patterns, noise, vectors) as inspiration to create your own composition. Your composition must include:
  - A custom class and an instance object of that class
  - One of the following: noise, trigonometry, vectors.
