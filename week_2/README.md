functions: like we did in class, this code makes a face using variables to store face positions, and a function to package everything together.

rotation: rotates the canvas and draws a single rectangle.

translation: uses the face drawing function from the 'functions' example and elaborates on it, using 'translate()' to draw it in multiple positions on the screen while still technically drawing at (0, 0).
