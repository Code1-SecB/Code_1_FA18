# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Arrays and Return
For this week, please submit two files:
- File 1: Take a look at Bryan Ma's array basics here. Fill out the answers and submit this as a separate file. If you can't figure out the answers, write comments for your thought process or questions you have about arrays. Take a look at the array documentation [here](https://processing.org/reference/Array.html).
- File 2: Review the documentation for [return](https://processing.org/reference/return.html) and create a sketch with the following:
  - An array of integers
  - An array of strings
  - An array of booleans
  - A function that returns the first value of the string array
  - A function that returns the last value of the string array
  - A function that loops through the integer array and prints out all the values
  - A function that loops through the boolean array and prints the opposite of each entry
  - Call these functions in your setup
- code should be thoroughly commented!
- any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!

### Extra credit
