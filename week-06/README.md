# Homework
All homework is due midnight before the next class!

### Arrays and Return
For this week, please submit two files:
- **File 1:** Take a look at Bryan Ma's array basics [here](https://github.com/Code1-SecB/Code_1_FA18/blob/master/week-06/homework/w6_01_arrayBasics/w6_01_arrayBasics.pde). Fill out the answers and submit this as a separate file. If you can't figure out the answers, write comments for your thought process or questions you have about arrays. Take a look at the array documentation [here](https://processing.org/reference/Array.html).
- **File 2:** Review the documentation for [return](https://processing.org/reference/return.html) and create a sketch with the following:
  - An array of integers
  - An array of strings
  - An array of booleans
  - A function that returns the first value of the string array
  - A function that returns the last value of the string array
  - A function that loops through the integer array and prints out all the values
  - A function that loops through the boolean array and prints the opposite of each entry
  - Call these functions in your setup
- code should be thoroughly commented!
- any borrowed code MUST be properly cited!

### Extra credit
Create a function that:
- takes in an array as a parameter
- updates the values in the array
- returns the updated array
- please provide a comment to let me know if you're attempting the extra credit

### Reading
Read FORM+CODE Ch.6 and submit a 100+ word response on Canvas
